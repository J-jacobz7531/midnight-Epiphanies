                    Coffee is a cornerstone of Uganda's economy and the primary livelihood for millions of its citizens. 
                    As the second-largest coffee producer in Africa and the eighth-largest globally, coffee is Uganda's 
                    top export, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue in 2023 and contributing to nearly 20% of the 
                    country's total export revenue. The industry supports over 1.8 million households, with coffee income 
                    often accounting for up to 50% of a household's annual revenue, despite it representing only about 20% 
                    of a farm's total crops.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the economic picture for farmers is complex and often challenging. A 2024 report by the social 
                    impact firm 60 Decibels revealed significant financial strain among Ugandan coffee farmers. Over one-third 
                    reported no profit in the previous year, and 21% reported financial losses. Additionally, 46% were unable 
                    to save any money, and 22% managed to save only occasionally. These findings highlight the vulnerability 
                    of smallholder farmers to price fluctuations and the high costs of production.

                      Women play a crucial role in coffee production, contributing up to 70% of the labor, but they often 
                      lack ownership of land and access to financial resources. Projects like the one led by Endiro Coffee 
                      in Bududa have empowered women by forming cooperatives, allowing them to gain financial independence 
                      and reduce their dependence on male relatives.

                      The Futureproof Coffee Uganda project also focuses on gender equality, providing women with training

                      Poverty and the need for farm labor have led to high rates of child labor in coffee-growing regions. 
                      In the Rwenzori and Masaka districts, a significant number of children are engaged in labor and are 
                      not attending school.

                    <p>
                      Addressing this issue requires a multi-faceted approach, including poverty alleviation, improving 
                      access to education, and changing cultural norms around child labor.

                    The environmental impact of coffee production in Uganda is a double-edged sword. While the sector

                        Coffee production has been linked to deforestation, particularly as farmers clear land for 
                        sun-grown coffee to increase yields. However, many Ugandan farms are smallholder operations 
                        that use agroforestry, integrating coffee trees with shade trees and other crops, which helps 
                        preserve biodiversity and protect soil health.
