            In impact investing, a Theory of Change (ToC) isn't just a framework, it's a roadmap, and a shared vision of how we bring about meaningful change. At its core, a ToC seeks to outline the intricate steps, outcomes, and ultimate impacts an organization aspires to achieve. For iGravity, the ToC is the lens through which we connect purpose with action, ensuring that each initiative, each investment, and each partnership advances a sustainable future.
